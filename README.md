Automated tests using Cucumber

CUCUMBER: Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style. Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand. As such, Cucumber allows the execution of feature documentation written in business-facing text.

CUCUMBER-AUTOMATION is a SCSB application where most of the functionalities in SCSB are automated and tested.
